DNS Request
When you type https://www.google.com and press Enter, the first step is the DNS (Domain Name System) resolution. Your browser needs to convert the human-readable domain name www.google.com into an IP address, which is the actual address of the server on the internet.

Browser Cache: The browser checks its cache to see if it has recently resolved this domain.
OS Cache: If not found, it queries the operating system’s cache.
Router Cache: The query might then go to your router’s DNS cache.
ISP DNS: If still unresolved, the request is sent to your ISP’s DNS server.
Recursive DNS Servers: If the ISP doesn’t have the answer, it queries other DNS servers, starting from the root DNS servers, moving to the TLD (Top-Level Domain) servers, and finally to the authoritative DNS server for google.com.
The DNS server responds with the IP address associated with www.google.com.

TCP/IP
Once the IP address is obtained, your browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to the server. TCP/IP (Internet Protocol) is the suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet.

Three-Way Handshake: The client (your browser) and server perform a three-way handshake to establish a connection. This involves:
SYN: The client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server.
SYN-ACK: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet.
ACK: The client sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server, completing the handshake.
Firewall
During this process, your request passes through various firewalls. Firewalls are security systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

Local Firewall: Your computer’s firewall checks if the outgoing request is permitted.
Network Firewall: Your router or ISP might also have firewalls that inspect the traffic.
Server-Side Firewall: On reaching Google’s servers, their firewalls ensure that the incoming request is legitimate and not malicious.
HTTPS/SSL
The https:// prefix indicates that the connection should be secure. HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) uses SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) to encrypt the data exchanged between your browser and the server.

SSL/TLS Handshake: This involves:
Server Certificate: The server sends its SSL certificate to the browser.
Certificate Verification: The browser verifies the certificate’s authenticity.
Session Keys: Both the browser and server generate session keys to encrypt the data during the session.
Load Balancer
For high-traffic websites like Google, a load balancer is used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. This ensures no single server is overwhelmed and helps in managing traffic efficiently.

Request Distribution: The load balancer analyzes incoming requests and directs them to the appropriate server based on various algorithms (round-robin, least connections, etc.).
Web Server
Once the request reaches the appropriate server, it is handled by a web server. The web server’s job is to process the request and serve the requested web page.

Request Handling: The web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) interprets the request and passes it to the application server if necessary.
Application Server
The application server hosts the web application’s logic. In the case of a search request on Google:

Processing Request: The application server runs the logic to process the search query.
Interacting with Databases: It may query databases to fetch relevant data.
Database
The database stores all the information required by the application. For a search query:

Data Retrieval: The database retrieves search results matching the query criteria.
Sending Data Back: The data is sent back to the application server, which formats it into a presentable response.
Response Back to Browser
Finally, the formatted response (usually in HTML/CSS/JavaScript) is sent back through the same TCP connection to your browser. Your browser renders the content, and you see the search results on the screen.
